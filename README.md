## CSRF Protection

### Description
 
+ Developed custom middleware in Node.js to defend against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
+ Implemented HMAC-based CSRF tokens to ensure integrity and prevent tampering, using the double-submit cookie pattern for secure, stateless request validation.
+ Built and tested a simple form-based frontend UI to validate CSRF protection functionality.
